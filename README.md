Aero 405 Thrust Stand Project

*By Cameron Gable (1iggy2), Anthony Russo, Hogan Hsu, Sergio Ramirez Sabogal*

This project is aimed towards providing a thrust testing stand for brushless electric motors
and propellers used by student project teams as part of Professor George Halowâ€™s AERO 495
course. Prof. Halow has indicated that there is currently a need for some of the project teams that
are part of his course to have an easy way to test the thrust capabilities of their electric motors and
propellers for applications ranging from quadcopters to fixed wing aircraft. Our project concept is
therefore a proposal to design, build, and test a modular thrust test stand that allows for multiple
motor and propeller sizes to be tested safely and effectively by any of the teams participating in
AERO 495. This test stand will use sensors to measure thrust, torque, voltage, current, and RPM
and involve a processing system for automated data collection for simple export to software like
Excel or MatLab for analysis.
